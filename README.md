I'm [Vlad](https://calendar.app.google/XwG6bWVp37iRzuL36). I started as a data scientist specialized in **NLP**, where I continue to train daily. But I also really like the world of startups, which is why I started several of them, one of which was accelerated by [Lanzadera accelerator](https://lanzadera.es/). As usually happens in these projects and what I really love, is that you have to learn everything üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, from how to manage the team, plan marketing strategies and go out to sell to clients (dealing with multiple rejections along the way üò™), until being a Fullstack Dev learning new tech on the fly. It's a very interesting experience üòç!

I leave you a summary of each startup and what I learned from them below üßê.

| Startup | <div style="height:32px;"><img src="https://grifenix-com.github.io/G-Images/branding/logo_cube_blue.svg" alt="Logo" style="height:32px;"></div> Grifenix | <div style="height:32px;"><img src="https://essenfy.github.io/essenfy-lib/logos/svg/e_logo_green_s.svg" alt="Logo" style="height:32px;"></div>Essenfy | Project 6 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Tech stuff used | Django REST, VueJS, Solidity, TailwindCSS, MongoDB, AWS (S3, EC2, RDS), Heroku, Ganache, Gunicorn, PM2, NGINX, Linux, Figma | Django REST, NextJS, TypeScript, PyTorch, Litestar, TailwindCSS, Postgres, AWS (S3, EC2, RDS), Gunicorn, PM2, NGINX, Linux, Figma | Django REST, NextJS, TypeScript, PyTorch, ScikitLearn, TailwindCSS, Postgres, AWS (S3, EC2, RDS), Gunicorn, PM2, NGINX, Linux, Figma |
| TOP 3 Lessons | Team management, blockchain & web development and B2B sales | B2B2C sales, Lean methodology and develop together with the client | Improving yet |
| Idea | "No-code smart contract builder platform" pivoted to "Blockchain based interlinked loyalty network platform" | "Platform to reduce food waste in medium-sized businesses, prioritizing the health of vulnerable people", betting on new forms of food delivery as well as store stock management | E-learning / Job search platform in the automotive sector |
| Reason of death | It stopped being profitable when many players appeared in the market with the same idea and the lack of innovation maneuver taking into account that everything was based on public Blockchains | The key innovations compared to the competition were not completely accepted or legal, so to continue with the same idea as the competition that is light years ahead, it was decided to stop the project. | Not today, too young yet üë∂üèº! |

| Role | CEO/CTO | CEO/CTO | Founder |
| Team | 3 | 3 | 1 ([Wanna join?](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladyslav-mazurkevych/)) |
